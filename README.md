# ðŸš¢ Titanic Survival Prediction

This project applies machine learning algorithms to predict passenger survival on the Titanic, based on the classic Kaggle competition dataset.

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

We explore, clean, and preprocess the Titanic dataset, then build and compare several ML models including:
- Random Forest Classifier
- Gradient Boosting Classifier
- XGBoost Classifier

Final predictions are evaluated and prepared for Kaggle submission.

## ðŸ§  Models and Accuracy

| Model                   | Accuracy on Test Set |
|------------------------|----------------------|
| Random Forest          | 82%               |
| Gradient Boosting      | 84%               |
| XGBoost                | 83%               |

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements

- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- xgboost
